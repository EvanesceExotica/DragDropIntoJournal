# DragDropIntoJournal

A solution made to make adding multiple images to journal entries easier, to work along with my [Journal-to-Canvas-Slideshow](https://github.com/EvanesceExotica/Journal-To-Canvas-Slideshow) module. 

**Important Note**: I'm fairly new to this; this is a hacky solution and definitely not a finished module. Use at your own risk, but feel free to make improvements as well as I'm sure there is a better way to do this haha. 

If someone can think of a better way to do this, such as automating steps 4 - 6 below, I'll gladly release this as an official module. ^ ^ 
For now I've hit a bit of a wall in trying to figure out improvements for this and my focus is on improving my main module, so any help would be appreciated. :)

**Note**: If you add images to a journal entry with content already in it, the images will be added to the bottom. You can cut and paste them to place them where you want in the entry with CTRL+X and CTRL+V.

## Install Instructions

Copy and paste the manifest url into your Foundry Installation.

## Instructions

1. Make sure the journal entry is NOT in edit mode --- meaning it's saved and you're simply viewing it. 

2. Drag an image or a group of images from your file system and into the journal entry.

3. The images will appear in the entry.  (DO NOT edit the journal entry or refresh your world at this point -- proceed to the next steps first)

4. Close the journal entry. 

5. Reopen the journal entry.

6. Edit the journal entry, and then save it.

Steps 4 - 6 should make it so the images are 'saved' within the journal entry even if you refresh. They will remain, and you can go in and edit the journal entry again, copy-paste the images with CTRL+X, CTRL+V, resize and rearrange them, add text, etc.
